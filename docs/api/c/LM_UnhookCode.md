# LM_UnhookCode

```c
LM_API lm_bool_t
LM_UnhookCode(lm_address_t from,
          lm_address_t trampoline,
          lm_size_t    size);
```

# Description

Removes a hook/detour from the address `from`, restoring its old code saved in the `trampoline` by copying `size` bytes from it into `from` in the calling process.

# Parameters

- from: the address where the hook will be removed.
- trampoline: the trampoline generated by the hook API, which contains the original code for the hooked function.
- size: the aligned hook size (which is the return value from the hook API).

# Return Value

On success, it returns `LM_TRUE`. On failure, it returns `LM_FALSE`.

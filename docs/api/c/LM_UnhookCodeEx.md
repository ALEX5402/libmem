# LM_UnhookCodeEx

```c
LM_API lm_bool_t
LM_UnhookCodeEx(lm_process_t *pproc,
        lm_address_t  from,
        lm_address_t  trampoline,
        lm_size_t     size);
```

# Description

Removes a hook/detour from the address `from`, restoring its old code saved in the `trampoline` by copying `size` bytes from it into `from` in a remote process.

# Parameters

- pproc: pointer to a valid process where the hook will be removed.
- from: the address where the hook will be removed.
- trampoline: the trampoline generated by the hook API, which contains the original code for the hooked function.
- size: the aligned hook size (which is the return value from the hook API).

# Return Value

On success, it returns `LM_TRUE`. On failure, it returns `LM_FALSE`.

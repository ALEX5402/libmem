# LM_UnhookCodeEx

```c
LM_API lm_bool_t LM_CALL
LM_UnhookCodeEx(const lm_process_t *process,
		lm_address_t        from,
		lm_address_t        trampoline,
		lm_size_t           size);
```

# Description
The function `LM_UnhookCodeEx` removes a hook/detour placed on the address `from` in a remote process, restoring it to its original state.
The function also frees the trampoline allocated by `LM_HookCodeEx`.

# Parameters
 - `process`: The `process` parameter is a pointer to a valid process where the hook was placed.
 - `from`: The `from` parameter is the address where the hook was placed.
 - `trampoline`: The `trampoline` parameter is the address of the trampoline generated by `LM_HookCodeEx`.
 - `size`: The `size` parameter is the amount of bytes occupied by the hook (aligned to the nearest instruction) in the remote process.

# Return Value
On success, it returns `LM_TRUE`. On failure, it returns `LM_FALSE`.
